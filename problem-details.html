        <p>
          Regulatory scrutiny of the integrity of RNA therapeutics is expected to increase and
the regulatory framework for this is in the process of being defined.
 Modified basesin smalRNAsand RNA therapeuticsare crucialfor the processing
 and the biologicalactivity through complex feedback networks involving their
 writing, erasing and sensing and disruption of which results in celular dysregulation
 and disease . For smalRNA drugsthe pattern and quality of intended modifications
 is therefore foundationalto their effectiveness and toxicity.
 Modified mRNA basesare also used by cels, for the regulation of half-life. Some
 mRNA therapieslike vaccines are intentionaly engineered with modified bases at
 specific positions to ensure persistence, while others are not, and in either case,
 their preparations can include RNAs with unintentionalbase modifications that create
 adverse events.
        </p>
        <p>
           Authorities are signaling interest in standardized approaches to ensure the safety
 and efficacy of RNA therapeutics including the detection and quantification of both
 intended and unintended base modifications, prompting cals for more rigorous,
 modificationaware analyticalassays in submission.
The problem is that while common contaminants such as dsRNA or plasmid DNA
 associated with the manufacturing process are easy to detect with existing
 technologies (e.g. LC-MS, PCRor chromatography), the discernment and
 quantification of modified nucleotides requires direct, de-novo RNA sequencing
 which has not yet been possible.
 This is the problem we elegantly solve at Directseq.

          <h3>Importance of Small RNA Base Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            Micro-ribonucleotides (miRNAs) regulate cellular homeostasis primarily through gene silencing. Modified
            ribonucleotide bases (e.g., m<sup>6</sup>A) are critical for this function, forming binding conformations for proteins
            involved in writing, erasing, and sensing. Because these pathways are tightly controlled in cells, quality assurance
            of intended base-modification distributions in small-RNA therapeutics is vital for patient safety.

        <article class="glass-card">
          <h3>Danger of Unintended RNA Base Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            Both phosphoramidite syntheses and IVT reactions can produce trace isomer contaminants containing unnatural
            ribonucleotide modifications via chemical degradation (oxidation, deamination, hydrolysis), supplier or lot
            impurities, and polymerase side-activities. Lot-to-lot variation in these isomers has been associated with serious
            adverse events—including, in rare cases, death.

          <h3>Analytical Limitations Today</h3>
          <p>
            Common contaminants like dsRNA or plasmid DNA are detectable by LC-MS, PCR, or chromatography, but
            <strong>modified nucleotide</strong> discernment and quantification requires direct, <em>de-novo</em> RNA sequencing—
            which has not been possible with conventional methods.

            Authorities are signaling interest in standardized, modification-aware assays in submissions to ensure the safety and
            efficacy of RNA therapeutics. Lack of visibility into intended and unintended base modifications creates critical risk
            and uncertainty for developers and regulators.

        <h2 class="h2-underline">A technology Leap is needed</h2>
        <p>
           Liquid Chromatography Mass Spec(LC-MS)is used for controlof amajority of the
 RNA therapeutic CriticalQuality Attributes (CQAs), but sequence identity
 assessments are normaly performed through RT-PCR, which is incapable of
 identifying nucleotide base modifications and quantifying the isomers containing
 them. Modified base isomer distributions should be added to the CriticalQuality
 Attribute list for RNA therapeutics, and these distributions can only be appreciated
 through direct RNA sequencing. The problem with direct RNA sequencing up until
 now isthat sequence could only be obtained from highly purified samples capable
 of producing complete ladders, and only in aconfirmatory manner which required
 pre-determined knowledge of the sequence. Incapable of simultaneous, direct, de
novo (and hypothesis-free)sequencing and quantitative assessment, prior state-of
the-art platforms for RNA sequencing such as LC-MSare incapable of rigorous
 quality control needed to identify unknown contaminating modified base.
 The RNA therapeutics Industry looks forward to the introduction of 'novelanalytical
 tools to gain more insight into the use of CQAs (CriticalQuality Attributes) such
 as sequence identity' . The most attractive tools wilalow addressing large numbers
 of CQAssimultaneously, such as LC-MScurrently does, while also opening doors
 beyond current limitations to address previously unaddressed facets of CQAs (such
 as modified base containing isomers)that have emerged during clinicaland post
clinical stages as potential safety concerns.

      <section class="glass-card">
        <h2 class="h2-underline">How DirectSeq Solves This</h2>
        <p>
           DirectSeq's Next Generation Mass Spec (DSMX™-Seq)platform is the significant
 technology leap patients, regulators and RNA therapeutics professionals have been
 waiting for.
 Instead of inferring RNA identity through mass readout, as with LC-MS, DSMX™-Seq-Seq
 reveals identity directly via de-novo sequencing.
 DSMX™-Seq-Seq delivers single-run, exhaustive, direct, 100% accurate sequencing of al
 RNA species in asample, including those containing any of up to 170+ base
 modifications. DSMX™-Seq-Seq alows for sequencing and quantification of not just the
 major RNA species, but each minor primary sequence isomer, including those
 containing one ribonucleotide base modification, multiple (even clustered) base
 modifications, and it delivers this sequence information while also delivering
 everything else that LC-MS does in terms of detection readout (e.g. presence of
sequencing length, secondary and tertiary structure variants, cofactors etc.).
 This represents asignificant advancement beyond the limitations of LC-MS, and
 opens the door for the first time to empirical, hypothesis- and bias-free assessment
 of RNA identity and quality. There is no modified base information loss due to a
 cDNA conversion step, as with RNAseq, and unlike with pore based technologies,
 modified ribonucleotide bases are sequenced whether they are isolated on the RNA
 strand or clustered.
 </p>
 <p>
 In 2024, we introduced DSMX™-Seq-Seq method asthe first solution to this problem.
 The 2D DSMX™-Seq-Seq platform overcame limitations associated the perfect ladder
 requirement, which only dominant RNA species can typicaly meet, and for the first
 time, extended sequencing reach of RNA therapeutic preparations to minor RNA
 isomerscontaining any number of canonicalor modified ribonucleotide base
 present in the sample. One of the first projects we worked on showed that even
 'pure' tRNA preparations purchased from prominent vendors were unexpectedly
 mixed with minor isoforms containing modified ribonucleotide bases.
 In 2025, we extended the power of 2D DSMX™-Seq-Seq to three dimensionsfor more
 powerfulde-novo sequence detection of minor RNA species. Our new 3D DSMX™-Seq
platform is now capable of not just detecting but sequencing and quantifiably
 (stoichiometricaly) mapping every RNA sequence in atherapeutic preparation,
 including minor modified base containing isomers, from more complex celular or
 IVTRNA preparations.
 </p>
 <p>
 DSMX™-Seq generates complete sequence for species down to < 1% abundance and
 some of the very first applications of DSMX™-Seq showed that even pure tRNA and
 sgRNA samplespurchased from reputable vendors(including those synthesized
 with phorphoramidite chemistry) contain modified base isomers at levels far greater
 than 1% .
 With obvious implications for elevating the state of the science for RNA therapeutics
 quality control, we intend to establish DSMX™-Seq as astandard-bearer for reducing
 lot to lot variability in contaminating RNA species that contribute to unintended off
target effects.

        <h2 class="h2-underline">More on our Technology</h2>
        <p>
             3D DSMXTM-Seq is the first RNA sequencing technology capable of directly
 sequencing and quantifying every sequence of amixed RNA sample, including minor
 isomers (down to 1%)differing by only asingle canonicalor modified base. 3D
 DSMXTM-Seq can identify alof the 170 known base modifications, whether only one
 or multiple are present, and unlike nanopore technologies, can read modified base
 sequences found in clusters, as they are commonly found in nature . It is adirect
sequencing technology (no cDNA step)and unlike other RNA sequencing
 technologies, the accuracy has been demonstrated at 100% for smalmodified
 nucleotide reference libraries.
 </p>
 <h2 class="h2-underline">How it works</h2>
 <p>
     The RNA ishydrolyzed into ladder fragments, which are resolved for the various
 isoforms by mass, intensity and retention time. Within each layer, short sequencing
 reads are generated de novo by base-caling nucleotides from mass differences
 between adjacent ladder fragments. The short reads are then assembled into ful
length RNA sequences. We routinely sequence siRNA, miRNA, CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs
 and mRNAswhether they contain modified ribonucleotide bases or not. We can
 also distinguish native from smal-molecular or other species-bound RNAs for RNA
targeted drug developers.
  <h2 class="h2-underline">Major Problems Solved with 3D DSMX™-Seq</h2>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>The ability to directly read RNA sequences in a highly parallel manner, where each species’ sequence assembly is compartmentalized.</li>
    <li>The ability to read RNA sequences <em>de novo</em> (without needing a pre-determined sequence reference).</li>
    <li>The ability to discern canonical from up to <strong>170 different modified ribonucleotide bases</strong> (e.g., pseudouracil, 5-methylcytidine, etc.), including those known to inhibit ribonucleotide hydrolysis—irrespective of their clustering.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 </section>

 <section class="glass-card">
        <h2 class="h2-underline">Demonstration of our Technology</h2>
        <p>
             Recent projects have sequenced tRNA, synthetic oligoribonucleotides, siRNA/miRNA
 mimics, sgRNA and tsRNA samples, and we are completing the validation work
 necessary to next take on mRNA samplesin the near future. Our tsRNA work
 provided crucialgranulation for noteworthy research published in Nature
 Communications, demonstrating the disruptive and transformative nature of our
 technology.
 </p>
 <p>
    One of the first demonstrations of DSMX™-Seq showcased its discriminatory
 sequencing power. We found that, surprisingly, acommercialy provided research
grade tRNA sample from areputable vendor wasactualy aheterogeneous mixture
 of five different length, canonicalribonucleotide base, and modified ribonucleotide
 base isomers. One of the two canonicalbase substitution isomers was present at a
 relative abundance of 0.6 (the other at 0.1), and two different modified base isomers
 were present at arelative abundance of about 0.2 . Later work demonstrated the
 homogeneouspurity of asynthetic 20bp ribonucleotide oligomer, its sensitivity and
 accuracy confirming not just sequence but stoichiometry of synthetic ribonucleotide
 oligomer mixtures.
 </p>
 <p>
     One of the most important demonstrations of DSMX™-Seq showed that a100
 nucleotide modified base sgRNA sample produced using phosphoramidite chemical
 synthesis was revealed to be amixture of the intended, major species along with
 impurity isomers arising from phosphoramidite chemistry. One length isomer (a
 truncation) represented 20.7% of the sample mass, and three unintended modified
ribonucleotide containing isomers were identified to represent 5.0%, 4.5% and 0.3%
 of the sample. This result is meaningfulto the RNA therapeutics industry, where
 ribonucleotide base integrity and purity of RNA drugs is generaly assumed when
 synthesized chemicaly, and suggests that such assumptions need to be revisited.
 Wehave also demonstrated sequencing on endogenous tsRNAs isolated from the
 liver of mice. A tsRNA-Glue-CTC species was isolated and shown to be present in
 four distinct modified ribonucleotide base isoforms, each containing asingle mC, D
 or D modified basesat positions 6, 19 and 20, respectively.
 </p>
 </section>

  <section class="glass-card">
        <h2 class="h2-underline">Regulatory</h2>
        <p>
             The next generation of mRNA drugsare already expanding beyond vaccines to
 additional disease states, staging the power of this revolutionary technology to fi l
 critical therapeutic gaps. But adverse events linked with particular delivery
 modalities and RNA contaminants are just now being fuly understood, and a
 regulatory framework is stilbeing defined.
 The major contaminants length truncations, dsRNA and plasmid template carryover from
 manufacturing are relatively easy to detect, but the same is not the case with modified
 nucleotide isomers. It has long been known that even low levelsof RNA therapeutic secondary
 and tertiary sequence isomerization can lead can lead to innate immune sensing, but
 mechanistic studies show that aberrantly modified ribonucleotides can lead to reduced
 regulatory control of translation efficiency, altered degradation kinetics, and even nuclear
 translocation and DNA integration , producing outsized biological effects relative to their
 abundance.
 </p>
 <p>
     The emergence of unusualy high adverse event rates for COVID vaccineswas a
 wake-up caland heightened public concern and scrutiny of RNA therapeutics. The
 COVID-19 mRNA vaccinescontained intentionaly engineered ribonucleotide
 modifications to enhance durability and reduce unintended immune response, but
 showed unexpectedly long spike protein mRNA persistence up to severalmonths
far longer than intended and lot to lot variation in contamination has been
 associated with varying levels of serious adverse events . Similar observations have
been made for monogenicreplacement RNA therapies.
 </p>
 <p>
     Product-specific impurities with unnaturalhalf-lives are a concern because their
 presences is not easily contro lable or knowable with current analytic
 instrumentation, and their effects not entirely testable in clinical trials of limited
 patient populations. Modified nucleotide incorporation in RNA therapeutics
 therefore merit carefulanalytical control and correlation with clinical safety data and
 we can expect an enhanced Quality Assurance framework for detecting and
 preventing their contribution to RNA therapeutics contamination going forward.
 This wilrequire new standards be developed, and the adoption of new technologies
 and proceduresto enable more comprehensive assessments of RNA complexity
 during lot analysis, including:
 <ul class="styled-list">
    <li> The use of better, more advanced technology that can detect and directly sequence
 every RNA species present in asample, de-novo, without the need for reference
 sequences.</li>
 <li>New RNA standards from NIST constituting mixtures of primary RNA with minor
 contaminant species of different primary, secondary and tertiary structures, including
 species that differ by as little as one, and by as many as 10 of the 170 known
 ribonucleotide base modifications</li>
 <li> Standardized, internaly validated operating procedures for using this advanced
 technology including the use of these new NIST RNA standards as controls for each lot
 analysis.</li>
 <li> Basic accreditation of laboratories running these standardized procedures including
 periodic blind chalenge proficiency assessments.</li>
 <li>More comprehensive quality reporting and storage; never again should we have to
 speculate about why different lots were associated with unexpected adverse events, or
 wish we had access to these lots later when the events become apparent.</li>
  </ul>

        <h3 class="h3-underline">Unbiased Sequencing of RNA Modifications & The Human RNome Project</h3>
        <p> RNA molecules encode biological information not only through their sequences but also through
 over 170 known chemical modifications1. These modifications influence RNA structure, stability,
 translation, and function—and are implicated in over 100 human diseases, including cancer,
 diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. As such, RNA and its modification profiles are emerging
 as powerful biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 </p>
 <p>
     Yet, our understanding of RNA sequence and modification diversity remains limited2. Current
 sequencing technologies offer partial insights but fail to provide the fu l spectrum of RNA
 sequence variants. In fact, we do not know how many unique RNA molecules or sequence
 variants are present in a sample, and further, we do not know the complete sequence content
 of each RNA, including the identity and location of every nucleotide (canonical or modified)
 within a full-length RNA.
 </p>
 <p>
    To overcome these limitations, we developed NGMS-Seq, anext-generation mass
 spectrometry-based sequencing platform. Unlike optical or electronic systems such as
 Illumina or Nanopore-based RNA sequencing, NGMS-Seq uses mass spectrometry as direct
 readout to comprehensively sequence full-length RNAs and their modifications—without bias or
 prior knowledge across isolated and bulk RNA samples.
 </p>

  <h2 class="h2-underline">NGMS-Seq enables three unprecedented capabilities: </h2>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>Exhaustive sequencing of every RNA sequence without omission (targeting al
 RNA molecules)</li>
 <li> Unbiased sequencing of al RNA modifications (targeting al RNA nucleotides,
 modified or not)</li>
 <li>Global profiling of RNA and its modifications in human diseases (targeting al RNA
 and modification changes) </li>
  </ul>

 <p>
    These capabilities pave the way for the world's first Human RNome Project, alandmark initiative
 to draft the first complete sequence of all human RNA molecules and their modifications.Just
 as Sanger sequencing enabled the Human Genome Project (completed in 2003), NGMS-Seq has
 potential to deliver the first complete Human RNome, transforming RNA biology, therapeutics,
 and diagnostics.
