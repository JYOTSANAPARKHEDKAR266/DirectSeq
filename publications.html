            <p class="pub-summary">
              This study introduces a hybridization-based purification method 
              that enables high-yield production of native and engineered tRNAs 
              from E. coli, preserving their natural post-transcriptional modifications and 
              translational activity. The method outperforms traditional in vitro transcription, 
              providing the first complete modification profiles of key tRNAs and offering a scalable 
              toolkit for translation and synthetic biology research.

            <p class="pub-summary">
              This review provides a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 
              (COVID-19), detailing its multisystem impact on the respiratory, 
              renal, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, as well as the risk 
              factors influencing disease severity. It emphasizes the virus's interaction with 
              the ACE2 receptor, the resulting pulmonary complications, and the 
              long-term post-COVID sequelae, highlighting the need for deeper understanding 
              of its pathophysiology, immune response, and long-term health consequences.

            <p class="pub-summary">
              This study presents MLC-Seq, a mass-spectrometry ladder 
              complementation sequencing method that enables de novo, 
              full-length sequencing of heterogeneous tRNAs with 
              single-nucleotide precision. Unlike next-generation sequencing, 
              it preserves and quantifies RNA modifications, revealing detailed 
              stoichiometric modification profiles and changes after enzymatic treatment, 
              thereby providing a comprehensive and quantitative view of tRNA sequence and 
              modification information.

            <h3 class="pub-title">Parent tRNA Modification Status Determines the Induction of Functional tRNA-Derived RNA by Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection</h3>
            <p class="pub-summary">
              This study reveals that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
              infection alters tRNA methylation, specifically demethylating 
              adenine at position 57 of tRNA-GluCTC, which enables its 
              cleavage into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs). 
              The enzyme AlkB homolog 1 mediates this demethylation, 
              leading to tRF production that influences RSV replication. 
              These findings highlight the role of tRNA post-transcriptional 
              modifications in tRF biogenesis and suggest a novel antiviral 
              target pathway in RSV infection.

            <p class="pub-summary">
              This work introduces 2D-HELS MS Seq, a two-dimensional 
              hydrophobic end-labeling strategy that enhances mass 
              spectrometry-based RNA sequencing by overcoming key technical 
              challenges in de novo sequencing of mixed and modified RNAs. 
              The method enables direct sequencing of both canonical and 
              modified nucleotides, including distinguishing isomeric 
              modifications such as pseudouridine (Ψ) and uridine (U), and 
              allows comprehensive analysis of single and mixed RNA samples

            <h3 class="pub-title">Direct Sequencing of tRNA by 2D-HELS-AA MS Seq Reveals Its Different Isoforms and Dynamic Base Modifications</h3>
            <p class="pub-summary">
             This study presents 2D-HELS-AA MS Seq, a direct mass spectrometry-based 
             RNA sequencing method that eliminates the need for cDNA synthesis and 
             enables complete sequencing of tRNAPhe while identifying and quantifying 
             eleven RNA modifications. The method uncovers partial modification 
             stoichiometries, detects novel truncated isoforms at the 3'-CCA tail, 
             and discovers a new isoform with A-G base transitions in the variable loop.
              By revealing isoforms, base editing, and modification stoichiometries invisible 
              to traditional sequencing, it offers a powerful new tool for epitranscriptomic 
              analysis and understanding RNA regulation.</p>

             This study demonstrates the 2D-HELS MS Seq method, 
             which integrates mass-retention time hydrophobic end-labeling 
             into mass spectrometry for direct, de novo RNA sequencing without

             and mixed RNA samples containing both canonical and modified 
             nucleotides, distinguishing modifications such as pseudouridine (Ψ) 
             and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) by their unique mass signatures.

            <h3 class="pub-title">A general LC-MS-based RNA sequencing method for direct analysis of multiple-base modifications in RNA mixtures</h3>
            <p class="pub-summary">
              This work introduces 2D-HELS MS Seq, the first direct, 
              modification-independent RNA sequencing method that combines 
              hydrophobic end-labeling with mass spectrometry to enable de novo 
              sequencing of single and mixed RNA samples. The technique 
              accurately identifies, locates, and quantifies both canonical 
              and modified bases at single-nucleotide resolution, including 
              partial modification stoichiometries found in real biological 
              samples. By overcoming the limitations of cDNA-based sequencing, 
              it represents a major advance toward comprehensive sequencing of 
              complex cellular RNAs and provides a valuable tool for quality 
              control of therapeutic RNAs.

            <h3 class="pub-title">Bidirectional Direct Sequencing of Noncanonical RNA by Two-Dimensional Analysis of Mass Chromatograms</h3>
            <p class="pub-summary">
              This study introduces a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
              (LC-MS) approach that simplifies the de novo sequencing of RNAs 
              containing noncanonical nucleotides by exploiting consistent 
              chromatographic separation patterns. Using a two-dimensional 
              analysis of compound chromatograms and a Monte Carlo algorithm 
              that generates bidirectional paired-end reads, the method precisely 
              locates modified nucleotides within RNA sequences. This innovation 
              overcomes the complexity of conventional MS data caused by multiple 
              fragmentation pathways and adducts, enabling routine LC-MS sequencing of 
              both natural and artificially modified RNAs.
